# EC-Salinity Sensor

An easy to use temperature compensated Electrical Conductivity sensor. With it, several other measurements can be derived to include:

  - Salinity
  - Siemens
  - PPM

#### Salinity
Determined by measuring EC and converting into salinity (PPT) using a temperature compensated formula.

#### Siemens
The SI unit of conductivity, usually expressed as S/cm.

#### PPM
Parts per million. Determined by converting EC.
